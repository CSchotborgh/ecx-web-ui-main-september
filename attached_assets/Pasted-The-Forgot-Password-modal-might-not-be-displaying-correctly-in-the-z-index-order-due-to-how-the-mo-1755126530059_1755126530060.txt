The "Forgot Password" modal might not be displaying correctly in the z-index order due to how the modal is structured in relation to other elements.

Ensure that the z-index of the modal overlay is higher than other elements that may be interfering. You've assigned it a z-index of 10000, which should generally suffice. However, if there are other components or styles applied elsewhere that may have higher z-index values, this can lead to issues.

Here is how you can ensure that the modal is setup correctly. First, make sure you've applied the modal class from your earlier example correctly:

<template>
  <div v-if="show" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <!-- Modal header -->
      <div class="modal-header flex items-center justify-between p-4 md:p-5 border-b rounded-t">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary">
          Forgot Password
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <!-- Your form for forgot password here -->
        <form @submit.prevent="handleForgotPassword">
          <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
const show = ref(false);
// Assuming you can display this modal by changing the `show` variable
const handleForgotPassword = () => {
  // Your password reset logic
};
defineExpose({ show });
</script>
<style scoped>
.modal {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); /* Dark overlay */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  z-index: 10000; /* Ensure this is high enough */
}
.modal-content {
  background-color: white; /* Solid background */
  padding: 30px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
</style>
Troubleshooting Steps:
Check Parent Components: Ensure that no parent containers of the modal have higher z-index values that could be overlapping.
Inspect with Dev Tools: Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the modal. Check the computed styles and see if other elements are overlapping or affecting its z-index.
Clear CSS Conflicts: Make sure that other CSS classes are not applying styles that override the modal's z-index or positioning.
If you have not yet applied the modal's CSS correctly or are mixing different modal implementations, make sure to unify the styles to prevent conflicts that could lead to display issues.
